<p><mark>Suto-2015</mark>: CONFRONTATION OF TOP-HAT SPHERICAL COLLAPSE AGAINST DARK HALOS FROM COSMOLOGICAL N-BODY SIMULATIONS</p>
<ul>
<li>The top-hat spherical collapse model (TSC) is one of the most fundamental analytical frameworks to describe the <strong>non-linear growth of cosmic structure</strong>. TSC has motivated, and been widely applied in, various researches even in the current era of precision cosmology. While numerous studies exist to examine its validity against numerical simulations in a statistical fashion, there are few analyses to compare the TSC dynamics in an <strong>individual object-wise basis</strong>, which is what we attempt in the present paper.</li>
<li>We extract $100$ halos at $z = 0$ from a cosmological N-body simulation according to the conventional TSC criterion for the spherical over-density. Then we trace back their spherical counter-parts at earlier epochs. Just prior to the turn-around epoch of the halos, <strong>their dynamics is well approximated by TSC</strong>, but their <strong>turn-around epochs are systematically delayed</strong> and the virial radii are larger by $\sim 20%$ on average relative to the TSC predictions.</li>
<li>We ﬁnd that this systematic deviation is mainly ascribed to the non-uniformity/inhomogeneity of dark matter density proﬁles and the non-zero velocity dispersions, <strong>both of which are neglected in TSC</strong>. In particular, the <strong>inside-out-collapse</strong> and <strong>shell-crossing</strong> of dark matter halos play an important role in generating the signiﬁcant velocity dispersion. The implications of the present result are brieﬂy discussed.</li>

<p><mark>Herrera-2019</mark>: Top-Hat Spherical Collapse with Clustering Dark Energy. I. Radius Evolution and Critical Contrast Density</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the influence of dark energy on the formation of structures is currently a major challenge in Cosmology, since it can distinguish otherwise degenerated viable models. In this work we consider the Top-Hat Spherical-Collapse (SC) model with <strong>dark energy</strong>, which can partially (or totally) cluster, according to a free parameter $\gamma$.</li>
<li>The lack of energy conservation has to be taken into account accordingly, as we will show. We determine characteristic quantities for the SC model, such as the <strong>critical contrast density</strong> and <strong>radius evolution</strong>, with particular emphasis on their dependence on the clustering parameter $\gamma$.</li>

<p><mark>East-2018</mark>: Comparing fully general relativistic and Newtonian calculations of structure formation</p>
<ul>
<li>In the standard approach to studying cosmological structure formation, the overall expansion of the Universe is assumed to be homogeneous, with the <strong>gravitational effect of inhomogeneities</strong> encoded entirely in a <strong>Newtonian potential</strong>.</li>
<li>A topic of ongoing debate is to what degree this fully captures the dynamics dictated by GR, especially in the era of precision cosmology. To quantitatively assess this, we directly compare standard N-body Newtonian calculations to full numerical solutions of the Einstein equations, for cold matter with various magnitude initial inhomogeneities on scales comparable to the <strong>Hubble horizon</strong>.</li>
<li>We analyze the differences in the evolution of density, luminosity distance, and other quantities defined with respect to <strong>fiducial observers</strong>. This is carried out by reconstructing the effective spacetime and matter fields dictated by the Newtonian quantities, and by taking care to distinguish effects of numerical resolution. We find that the fully general relativistic and Newtonian calculations show excellent agreement, even well into the nonlinear regime. They only notably differ in regions where the weak gravity assumption breaks down, which arise when considering extreme cases with perturbations exceeding standard values.</li>

<p><mark>East 2012</mark>: Hydrodynamics in full general relativity with conservative AMR</p>
<ul>
<li>There is great interest in numerical relativity simulations involving matter due to the likelihood that binary compact objects involving neutron stars will be detected by gravitational wave observatories in the coming years, as well as to the possibility that binary compact object mergers could explain short-duration gamma-ray bursts. We present a code designed for simulations of hydrodynamics coupled to the Einstein field equations targeted toward such applications. This code has recently been used to study eccentric mergers of black hole-neutron star binaries. We evolve the fluid conservatively using high-resolution shock-capturing methods, while the field equations are solved in the generalized-harmonic formulation with finite differences. In order to resolve the various scales that may arise, we use adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) with grid hierarchies based on truncation error estimates. A noteworthy feature of this code is the implementation of the flux correction algorithm of Berger and Colella to ensure that the conservative nature of fluid advection is respected across AMR boundaries. We present various tests to compare the performance of different limiters and flux calculation methods, as well as to demonstrate the utility of AMR flux corrections.</li>

<p><mark>Munoz 2022</mark>: EBWeyl: a Code to Invariantly Characterize Numerical Spacetimes</p>
<ul>
<li>Relativistic cosmology can be formulated covariantly, but in dealing with numerical relativity simulations a gauge choice is necessary. Although observables should be gauge-invariant, simulations do not necessarily focus on their computations, while it is useful to extract results invariantly. To this end, in order to invariantly characterize spacetimes resulting from cosmological simulations, we present two different methodologies to compute the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, E αβ and B αβ , from which we construct scalar invariants and the Weyl scalars. The first method is geometrical, computing these tensors in full from the metric, and the second uses the 3 + 1 slicing formulation. We developed a code for each method and tested them on five analytic metrics, for which we derived E αβ and B αβ and the various scalars constructed from them with computer algebra software. We find excellent agreement between the analytic and numerical results. The slicing code outperforms the geometrical code for computational convenience and accuracy; on this basis we make it publicly available in github with the name EBWeyl. We emphasize that this post-processing code is applicable to any numerical spacetime in any gauge.</li>

<p><mark>Munoz 2023</mark>: Structure formation and quasi-spherical collapse from initial curvature perturbations with numerical relativity simulations</p>
<ul>
<li>We use numerical relativity simulations to describe the spacetime evolution during nonlinear structure formation in ΛCDM cosmology. Fully nonlinear initial conditions are set at an initial redshift $z\approx300$, based directly on the gauge invariant comoving curvature perturbation $R_c$ commonly used to model early-universe fluctuations.</li>
<li>Assigning a simple 3-D sinusoidal structure to $R_c$ , we then have a lattice of quasi-spherical over-densities <strong>representing idealised dark matter halos connected through filaments and surrounded by voids</strong>. This structure is implemented in the synchronous-comoving gauge, using a pressureless perfect fluid (dust) description of CDM, and then it is fully evolved with the Einstein Toolkit code.</li>
<li>With this, we look into whether the <strong>Top-Hat spherical and homogeneous collapse model</strong> provides a good description of the collapse of over-densities. We find that the Top-Hat is an excellent approximation for the evolution of peaks, where we observe that the shear is negligible and collapse takes place when the linear density contrast reaches the predicted critical value $\delta_C= 1.69$. Additionally, we characterise the outward expansion of the turn-around boundary and show how it depends on the initial distribution of matter, finding that it is faster in denser directions, incorporating more and more matter in the infalling region.</li>
<li>Using the EBWeyl code we look at the distribution of the <strong>electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor</strong>, finding that they&rsquo;re stronger along and around the filaments, respectively. We introduce a method to <strong>dynamically classify the different regions of the simulation box in Petrov types</strong>. With this, we find that the spacetime is of Petrov type I everywhere, as expected, but we can identify the leading order type in each region and at different times. Along the filaments, the leading Petrov type is D, while the centre of the over-densities remains <strong>conformally flat</strong>, type O, in line with the Top-Hat model.</li>
<li>The surrounding region demonstrates a sort of peeling-off in action, with the spacetime transitioning between different Petrov types as non-linearity grows, with production of gravitational waves.</li>

<p><mark>Bruni 2014</mark>: Non-Gaussian initial conditions in ΛCDM: Newtonian, relativistic, and primordial contributions</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of the present paper is to set initial conditions for structure formation at non-linear order, consistent with GR, while also allowing for primordial non-Gaussianity. We use the non-linear continuity and Raychaudhuri equations, which together with the non-linear energy constraint <strong>determine the evolution of the matter density fluctuation in GR</strong>. We solve this equations at 1st and 2nd order in a perturbative expansion, recovering and extending previous results derived in the matter-dominated limit and in the Newtonian regime. We present a second-order solution for the comoving density contrast in a ΛCDM universe, identifying non-linear contributions coming from the Newtonian growing mode, primordial non-Gaussianity and intrinsic non-Gaussianity, due to the essential non-linearity of the relativistic constraint equations. We discuss the application of these results to initial conditions in N-body simulations, showing that relativistic corrections mimic a non-zero non-linear parameter $f_{NL}$</li>

<p><mark>Simonyan-2015</mark>: VERY DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR LARGE SCALE IMAGE RECOGNITION</p>
<ul>
<li>In this work we investigate the <strong>effect of the CNN depth on its accuracy</strong> in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to <strong>16–19 weight layers</strong>.</li>
<li>These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisa- tion and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.</li>

<p><mark>Gal-2016</mark>: Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Dep Learning</p>
<ul>
<li>ML tools for regression and classification do not capture <strong>model uncertainty</strong>. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting <strong>dropout training in deep NNs as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes</strong>.</li>
<li>A direct result of this theory gives us <strong>tools to model uncertainty</strong> with dropout NNs – extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far.</li>
<li>This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example.</li>
<li>We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.</li>

<p><mark>He 2016</mark>: Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8×deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC &amp; COCO 2015 competitions 1 , where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.</li>

<p><mark>Krizhevsky 2012</mark>: ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</p>
<ul>
<li>We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 dif- ferent classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train- ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen- tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.</li>

<p><mark>Lucie-Smith 2018</mark>: Machine learning cosmological structure formation</p>
<ul>
<li>We train a ML algorithm to learn cosmological structure formation from N-body simulations. The algorithm infers the <strong>relationship between the initial conditions and the final dark matter haloes</strong>, without the need to introduce approximate halo collapse models.</li>
<li>We gain <strong>insights into the physics driving halo formation</strong> by evaluating the predictive performance of the algorithm when provided with different types of information about the local environment around dark matter particles.</li>
<li><strong>The algorithm learns to predict whether or not dark matter particles will end up in haloes of a given mass range</strong>, based on spherical overdensities.</li>
<li>We show that the resulting predictions match those of spherical collapse approximations such as extended Press-Schechter theory.</li>
<li>Additional information on the shape of the local gravitational potential is <strong>not able to improve halo collapse predictions</strong>; the linear density field contains sufficient information for the algorithm to also reproduce <strong>ellipsoidal collapse</strong> predictions based on the <strong>Sheth-Tormen model</strong>.</li>
<li>We investigate the algorithm’s performance in terms of halo mass and radial position and perform <strong>blind analyses on independent initial conditions realisations</strong> to demonstrate the generality of our results.</li>

<li>The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for <strong>increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant</strong>.</li>
<li>To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the <strong>Hebbian principle</strong> and the <strong>intuition of multi-scale processing</strong>.</li>

The variant, together with other popular CNNs, are applied to a sample of <strong>28790 galaxy images</strong> from <strong>Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset</strong>, to classify galaxies into <strong>five classes</strong>, i.e. completely round smooth, in-between smooth (between completely round and cigar-shaped), cigar-shaped smooth, edge-on and spiral. A variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 value and AUC, show that the proposed network achieves the <strong>state-of-the-art classification performance</strong> among the networks, namely, Dieleman, AlexNet, VGG, Inception and ResNets.</li>
<li>The overall classification accuracy of our network on the testing set is <strong>95.2083%</strong> and the accuracy of each type is given as: completely round, 96.6785%; in-between, 94.4238%; cigar-shaped, 58.6207%; edge-on, 94.3590% and spiral, 97.6953% respectively.</li>

<p><mark>De la Calleja 2004</mark>: Machine learning and image analysis for morphological galaxy classification</p>
<ul>
<li>We present an experimental study of ML and image analysis for performing automated morphological galaxy classification. We used a <strong>NN</strong>, and a <strong>locally weighted regression</strong> method, and implemented <strong>homogeneous ensembles of classifiers</strong>. The ensemble of NNs was created using the <strong>bagging ensemble method</strong>, and manipulation of input features was used to create the ensemble of locally weighed regression.</li>
<li>The galaxies used were rotated, centred, and cropped, all in a fully automatic manner. In addition, we used <strong>PCA</strong> to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and to extract relevant information in the images.</li>
<li>Preliminary experimental results using 10-fold CV show that the homogeneous ensemble of locally weighted regression produces the best results, with over 91% accuracy when considering three galaxy types (E, S and Irr), and over 95% accuracy for two types (E and S).</li>

<p><mark>Dieleman 2015</mark>: Rotation-invariant convolutional neural networks for galaxy morphology prediction</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring the morphological parameters of galaxies is a key requirement for studying their formation and evolution. Surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have resulted in the availability of very large collections of images, which have permitted population-wide analyses of galaxy morphology.</li>
<li>Morphological analysis has traditionally been carried out mostly via <strong>visual inspection by trained experts</strong>, which is time consuming and does not scale to large   ($\gtrsim10^4$) numbers of images. Although attempts have been made to build automated classification systems, these have <strong>not been able to achieve the desired level of accuracy</strong>.</li>
<li>The Galaxy Zoo project successfully applied a <strong>crowdsourcing strategy</strong>, inviting online users to classify images by answering a series of questions. Unfortunately, even this approach <strong>does not scale well enough</strong> to keep up with the increasing availability of galaxy images.</li>
<li>We present a deep NN model for galaxy morphology classification which exploits <strong>translational and rotational symmetry</strong>. It was developed in the context of the <strong>Galaxy Challenge</strong>, an international competition to build the best model for morphology classification based on annotated images from the Galaxy Zoo project. For images with high agreement among the Galaxy Zoo participants, our model is able to reproduce their consensus with <strong>near-perfect accuracy</strong> ($&gt;99$) for most questions. Confident model predictions are highly accurate, which makes the model suitable for filtering large collections of images and forwarding challenging images to experts for manual annotation.</li>
<li>This approach greatly reduces the experts’ workload without affecting accuracy. The application of these algorithms to larger sets of training data will be critical for analysing results from future surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</li>

Interpretability in ML is undoubtedly important, but the calculations of neural networks are very challenging to understand. Attempts to see inside their hidden layers can either be <strong>misleading, unusable, or rely on the latent space to possess properties that it may not have</strong>.</li>
<li>In this work, rather than attempting to analyze a NN posthoc, we introduce a mechanism, called <strong>concept whitening</strong> (CW), to alter a given layer of the network to allow us to better understand the computation leading up to that layer. When a concept whitening module is added to a CNN, <strong>the axes of the latent space are aligned with known concepts of interest</strong>.</li>
<li>By experiment, we show that CW can provide us a much clearer understanding for how the network gradually learns concepts over layers. CW is an alternative to a <strong>batch normalization layer</strong> in that it normalizes, and also <strong>decorrelates</strong> (whitens) the latent space.</li>
<li>CW can be used in any layer of the network without hurting predictive performance.</li>

<p><mark>Katebi 2018</mark>: Galaxy morphology prediction using capsule networks</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding morphological types of galaxies is a key parameter for studying their formation and evolution. NN that have been used previously for galaxy morphology classification have some disadvantages, such as <strong>not being invariant under rotation</strong>.</li>
<li>In this work, we studied the performance of Capsule Network, a recently introduced NN architecture that is rotationally invariant and spatially aware, on the task of galaxy morphology classification. We designed two evaluation scenarios based on the answers from the question tree in the <strong>Galaxy Zoo project</strong>.
<ul>
<li>In the first scenario, we used Capsule Network for regression and predicted probabilities for all of the questions.</li>
<li>In the second scenario, we chose the answer to the first morphology question that had the highest user agreement as the class of the object and trained a Capsule Network classifier, where we also <strong>reconstructed galaxy images</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We achieved promising results in both of these scenarios. Automated approaches such as the one introduced here will greatly decrease the workload of astronomers and will play a critical role in the upcoming large sky surveys.</li>

<li>We find that <strong>dynamical dark energy</strong> comes out on top, or in the ABC language <strong>naturally selected</strong>, over the standard ΛCDM cosmological scenario.

<p><mark>Giblin-2018</mark>: The Limited Accuracy of Linearized Gravity</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard cosmological models rely on an approximate treatment of gravity, utilizing solutions of the linearized Einstein equations as well as physical approximations. In an era of precision cosmology, we should ask: are these approximate predictions sufficiently accurate for comparison to observations, and can we draw meaningful conclusions about properties of our Universe from them? In this work we examine the accuracy of linearized gravity in the presence of collisionless matter and a cosmological constant utilizing fully general relativistic simulations. We observe the gauge-dependence of corrections to linear theory, and note the amplitude of these corrections. For perturbations whose amplitudes are in line with expectations from the standard ΛCDM model, we find that the full, general relativistic metric is well-described by linear theory in Newtonian and harmonic gauges, while the metric in comoving-synchronous gauge is not. For the largest observed structures in our Universe, our results suggest that corrections to linear gravitational theory can reach or surpass the percent-level.</li>

<p>Tian-2021: On the question of measuring spatial curvature in an inhomogeneous universe</p>
<ul>
<li>The curvature of a spacetime, either in a topological sense, or averaged over super-horizon-sized patches, is often equated with the global curvature term that appears in Friedmann’s equation. In general, however, the Universe is inhomogeneous, and gravity is a nonlinear theory, thus any curvature perturbations violate the assumptions of the FLRW model; it is not necessarily true that local curvature, averaged over patches of constant-time surfaces, will reproduce the observational effects of global symmetry. Further, the curvature of a constant-time hypersurface is not an observable quantity, and can only be inferred indirectly. Here, we examine the behavior of curvature modes on hypersurfaces of an inhomogeneous spacetime non-perturbatively in a numerical relativistic setting, and how this curvature corresponds with that inferred by observers. We also note the point at which observations become sensitive to the impact of curvature sourced by inhomogeneities on inferred average properties, finding general agreement with past literature.</li>

<p>Farsi-2023: Evolution of Spherical Overdensities in Energy-Momentum-Squared Gravity</p>
<ul>
<li>Employing the spherical collapse (SC) formalism, we investigate the <strong>linear evolution of the matter overdensity</strong> for <strong>energy-momentum-squared gravity</strong> (EMSG), which in practical phenomenological terms, one may imagine as an extension of the ΛCDM model of cosmology. The underlying model, while still having a cosmological constant, is a non-linear material extension of GR and includes correction terms that are dominant in the high-energy regime, the early universe.</li>
<li>Considering the FRW background in the presence of a cosmological constant, we find the effects of the modifications arising from EMSG on the growth of perturbations at the early stages of the universe. Considering both possible negative and positive values of the <strong>model parameter of EMSG</strong>, we discuss its role in the evolution of the matter density contrast and growth function in the level of linear perturbations.</li>
<li>While EMSG leaves imprints distinguishable from ΛCDM, we find that the negative range of the ESMG model parameter is <strong>not well-behaved</strong>, indicating an anomaly in the parameter space of the model. In this regard, for the evaluation of the galaxy cluster number count in the framework of EMSG, we equivalently provide an analysis of the number count of the gravitationally collapsed objects (or the <strong>dark matter halos</strong>).</li>
<li>We show that the galaxy cluster number count decreases compared to the ΛCDM model. In agreement with the hierarchical model of structure formation, in EMSG cosmology the <strong>more massive structures are less abundant</strong>, meaning that form at later times.</li>

<p>Riess 1998: Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant</p>
<ul>
<li>We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 ≤ z ≤ 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the mass density ($\Omega_M$), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, $\Omega_\Lambda$), the deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and the dynamical age of the Universe ($t_0$).</li>
<li>The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density ($\Omega_M=0.2$) Universe without a cosmological constant.</li>
<li>Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously <strong>favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant</strong> (i.e., $\Omega_\Lambda&gt;0$) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., $q_0&lt;0$). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Ω M ≥ 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q 0 &lt; 0 at the 2.8σ and 3.9σ confidence levels, and with $\Omega_\Lambda&gt;0$ at the $3.0\sigma$ and $4.0\sigma$ confidence levels, for two different fitting methods respectively.</li>
<li>Fixing a “minimal” mass density, Ω M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Ω Λ &gt; 0 at the 3.0σ confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat-Universe prior (Ω M + Ω Λ = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Ω Λ &gt; 0 at 7σ and 9σ formal significance for the two different fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Ω M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7σ to 8σ confidence level for the two different fitting methods.</li>
<li>We estimate the dynamical age of the Universe to be 14.2 ±1.5 Gyr including <strong>systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale</strong>.</li>

<p><mark>Ávila 2025</mark>: Transverse BAO scale measurement at $z_\text{eff}= 1.725$ with the <strong>SDSS</strong> quasars catalog</p>
<ul>
<li>Studying the <strong>SDSS-DR16</strong> quasar catalog, we detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the <strong>two-point angular correlation function</strong> with a [[statistical significance]] of <strong>3σ</strong>, at an effective redshift of $z_\text{eff}= 1.725$. Using a simple parameterization—comprising a polynomial plus a Gaussian function—we measure the transverse BAO scale as $θ_\text{BAO} = 1.928^\circ \pm 0.094^\circ$. This measurement is obtained from a narrow redshift shell, $z \in [1.72, 1.73]$ (i.e., ∆z = 0.01), <strong>thin enough that projection-effect corrections are negligible</strong>, making it only weakly dependent on the assumed [[fiducial]] cosmology. The only assumption adopted is isotropy in the computation of the correlation function, further ensuring that the result depends only weakly on specific cosmological-model hypotheses.</li>
<li>We also investigate possible systematics that could affect the detection or significance of the BAO signal and find them to be subdominant or implausible.</li>
<li>When combined with other transverse BAO measurements from the literature, our result shows <strong>good concordance</strong>—within the <strong>1σ confidence level</strong>—with the cosmological parameter values reported by the <strong>Planck and DESI collaborations</strong>.</li>
<li>This new measurement of the transverse BAO scale, obtained from the SDSS quasar sample with minimal cosmological-model assumptions, provides an additional independent constraint for updated statistical studies aimed at probing the nature of dark energy.</li>

<p>Carballo-Rubio-2022: Unimodular Gravity vs General Relativity: A status report</p>
<ul>
<li>Unimodular Gravity (UG) is an alternative to General Relativity (GR) which, however, is so closely related to the latter that one can wonder to what extent they are different. The different behavior of the cosmological constant in the semiclassical regimes of both frameworks suggests the possible existence of additional contrasting features.</li>
<li>UG and GR are based on two different gauge symmetries: UG is based on <strong>transverse diffeomorphisms</strong> and <strong>Weyl rescalings</strong> (WTDiff transformations), whereas GR is based on the <strong>full group of diffeomorphisms</strong>. This difference is related to the existence of a fiduciary background structure, a fixed volume form, in UG theories. In this work we present an overview as complete as possible of situations and regimes in which one might suspect that some differences between these two theories might arise. This overview contains analyses in the classical, semiclassical, and quantum regimes. When a particular situation is well known we make just a brief description of its status. For situations less analyzed in the literature we provide here more complete analyses. Whereas some of these analyses are sparse through the literature, many of them are new. Apart from the completely different treatment they provide for the cosmological constant problem, our results uncover no further differences between them. We conclude that, to the extent that the technical naturalness of the cosmological constant is regarded as a fundamental open issue in modern physics, UG is preferred over GR since the cosmological constant is technically natural in the former.</li>

<ul>
<li>We investigate the transverse modes of the gravitational and velocity fields in ΛCDM, based on a high-resolution simulation performed using the AMR general-relativistic N-body code <strong>GRAMSES</strong>.</li>
<li>We study the generation of vorticity in the dark matter velocity field at low redshift, providing fits to the shape and evolution of its <strong>power spectrum over a range of scales</strong>. By analysing the gravitomagnetic vector potential, which is absent in Newtonian simulations, in dark matter haloes with masses ranging from $∼10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_\text{sun}$ to $∼10^{15} h^{−1} M_\text{sun}$, we find that its magnitude correlates with the halo mass, peaking in the inner regions. Nevertheless, on average, its ratio against the scalar gravitational potential remains fairly constant, below percent level, decreasing roughly linearly with redshift and showing a weak dependence on halo mass.</li>
<li>Furthermore, we show that the gravitomagnetic acceleration in haloes peaks towards the core and reaches almost $10^{−10} h cm/s^2$ in the most massive halo of the simulation. However, regardless of the halo mass, the ratio between the gravitomagnetic force and the standard gravitational force is typically at around the $10^{−5}$ level inside the haloes, again without significant radius dependence.</li>
<li>This result confirms that the <strong>gravitomagnetic effects have negligible impact on structure formation</strong>, even for the most massive structures, although its behaviour in low density regions remains to be explored. Likewise, the impact on observations remains to be understood in the future.</li>

Then, using these equations, we obtain the generalized Misner-Sharp energy within the framework of this model. We consider the thermodynamic behavior of the <strong>apparent horizon</strong> and derive the equations of state related to the pressure, temperature, and radius of the apparent horizon. Using the thermodynamic pressure, we obtain the critical points corresponding to <strong>phase transitions</strong>.</li>
<li>We determine the critical temperature and critical radius in terms of model parameters, including the quadratic coupling and the cosmological constant. We also examine key thermodynamic quantities, such as Wald entropy, specific heat at constant pressure, enthalpy, Gibbs free energy. By examining the behavior of these quantities, we can gain insight into the thermodynamic stability of the quadratic gravity model. In particular, we find that quadratic terms change the stability conditions and can lead to new thermodynamic behaviors compared to GR.</li>

The models are directed-network implementations of the Ising model, Ising model with absorbing states, and majority voter models.</li>
<li>When these nonequilibrium models are driven by the heat-bath dynamics, their stationary characteristics, such as magnetization, are correctly reproduced by MFA as confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.

Here, we compute the surface tension, saturation pressure and enthalpy of vaporization for a range of temperatures spanning from 300 to 600 K, and evaluate the Deep Potential model performance against experimental results and the semi-empirical TIP4P/2005 classical model. Moreover, by employing the seeding technique, we evaluate the free energy barrier and nucleation rate at negative pressures for the isotherm of 296.4 K. We find that the nucleation rates obtained from the Deep Potential model deviate from those computed for the TIP4P/2005 water model, due to an underestimation in the surface tension from the Deep Potential model. From analysis of the seeding simulations, we also evaluate the Tolman length for the Deep Potential water model, which is (0.091 ± 0.008) nm at 296.4 K. Lastly, we identify that water molecules display a preferential orientation in the liquid-vapor interface, in which H atoms tend to point towards the vapor phase to maximize the enthalpic gain of interfacial molecules. We find that this behaviour is more pronounced for planar interfaces than for the curved interfaces in bubbles. This work represents the first application of Deep Potential models to the study of liquid-vapor coexistence and water cavitation.</li>

<ul>
<li>We show that numerical computations based on tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods can be signiﬁcantly accelerated with PyTorch on graphics processing units (GPUs) by leveraging NVIDIA’s Compute Uniﬁed Device Architecture (CUDA). We ﬁnd improvement in the runtime (for a given accuracy) and its scaling with bond dimension for two-dimensional systems. Our results establish that utilization of GPU resources is essential for future precision computations with TRG.</li>

<p><mark>CHERRINGTON 2008</mark>: A DUAL ALGORITHM FOR NON-ABELIAN YANG-MILLS COUPLED TO DYNAMICAL FERMIONS</p>
<ul>
<li>We extend the dual algorithm recently described for pure, non-abelian Yang-Mills on the lattice to the case of lattice fermions coupled to Yang-Mills, by constructing an ergodic Metropolis algorithm for dynamic fermions that is local, exact, and built from gauge-invariant boson-fermion coupled configurations. Fon concreteness, we present in detail the case of 3D, for the group SU(2) and staggered fermions, however the algorithm readily generalizes with regard to group and dimension.</li>
<li>The treatment of the fermion determinant makes use of a polymer expansion; as with previous proposals making use of the polymer expansion in higher than 2D, the critical question for practical applications is whether the presence of negative amplitudes can be managed in the continuum limit.</li>

<p><mark>Arevalo-2023</mark>: Sensitivity of Simulated Conditions to Different Parameterization Choices Over Complex Terrain in Central Chile</p>
<ul>
<li>This study evaluates the performance of 14 high-resolution WRF runs with different combinations of parameterizations in simulating the atmospheric conditions over the complex terrain of central Chile during austral winter and spring.</li>
<li>We focus on the <strong>validation of results for coastal, interior valleys, and mountainous areas independently</strong>, and also present an in-depth analysis of two synoptic-scale events that occurred during the study period: a frontal system and a cut-off low.</li>
<li>The performance of the simulations decreases from the coast to higher altitudes, even though the differences are not very clear between the coast and interior valleys for ws10 and precipitation. The simulated vertical profiles show a warmer and drier boundary layer and a cooler and moister free atmosphere than observed. The choice of the land-surface model has the largest positive impact on near-surface variables with the five-layer thermal diffusion scheme showing the smallest errors.</li>
<li>Precipitation is more sensitive to the choice of cumulus parameterizations, with the simplified <strong>Arakawa–Schubert scheme</strong> generally providing the best performance for absolute errors. When examining the performance of the model simulating rain/no-rain events for different thresholds, also the cumulus parameterizations better represented the false alarm ratio (FAR) and the bias score (BS). However, the <strong>Morrison microphysics scheme</strong> resulted in the best critical success index (CSI), while the probability of detection (POD) was better in the simulation without analysis nudging.</li>
<li><strong>Overall</strong>, these results provide guidance to other researchers and help to identify the best WRF configuration for a specific research or operational goal.</li>

<p>Kratzert-2019: Toward Improved Predictions in Ungauged Basins: Exploiting the Power of Machine Learning</p>
<ul>
<li>Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks offer unprecedented accuracy for prediction in ungauged basins. We trained and tested several LSTMs on 531 basins from the CAMELS data set using k-fold validation, so that predictions were made in basins that supplied no training data. The training and test data set included ∼ 30 years of daily rainfall-runoff data from catchments in the United States ranging in size from 4 to 2,000 km 2 with aridity index from 0.22 to 5.20, and including 12 of the 13 IGPB vegetated land cover classifications. This effectively “ungauged” model was benchmarked over a 15-year validation period against the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model and also against the NOAA National Water Model reanalysis. SAC-SMA was calibrated separately for each basin using 15 years of daily data. The out-of-sample LSTM had higher median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies across the 531 basins (0.69) than either the calibrated SAC-SMA (0.64) or the National Water Model (0.58). This indicates that there is (typically) sufficient information in available catchment attributes data about similarities and differences between catchment-level rainfall-runoff behaviors to provide out-of-sample simulations that are generally more accurate than current models under ideal (i.e., calibrated) conditions. We found evidence that adding physical constraints to the LSTM models might improve simulations, which we suggest motivates future research related to physics-guided machine learning</li>

<p><mark>Kratzert-2019</mark>: Towards Learning Universal, Regional, and Local Hydrological Behaviors via Machine-Learning Applied to Large-Sample Datasets</p>
<ul>
<li>Regional rainfall-runoff modeling is an old but still mostly out-standing problem in Hydrological Sciences. The problem currently is that traditional hydrological models <strong>degrade significantly in performance when calibrated for multiple basins together instead of for a single basin alone</strong>.</li>
<li>In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach using LSTMs, and demonstrate that under a ’big data’ paradigm, this is not necessarily the case. By training a single LSTM model on 531 basins from the CAMELS data set using <strong>meteorological time series data and static catchment attributes</strong>, we were able to significantly improve performance compared to a set of several different hydrological benchmark models.</li>
<li>Our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated regionally but also achieves <strong>better performance than hydrological models that were calibrated for each basin individually</strong>. Furthermore, we propose an adaption to the standard LSTM architecture, which we call an <mark>Entity-Aware-LSTM (EA-LSTM)</mark>, that allows for learning, and embedding as a feature layer in a deep learning model, <strong>catchment similarities</strong>. We show that this learned catchment similarity corresponds well with what we would expect from prior hydrological understanding.</li>

<p><mark>Addor 2018</mark>: Selection of hydrological signatures for large-sample hydrology</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrological signatures are now used for a wide range of purposes, including <strong>catchment classification</strong>, process exploration and <strong>hydrological model calibration</strong>. The recent boost in the popularity and number of signatures has however not been accompanied by the development of clear guidance on signature selection, meaning that signature selection is often arbitrary. Here we use three complementary approaches to compare and rank 15 commonly-used signatures, which we evaluate in 671 US catchments from the CAMELS data set (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies).</li>
<li>Firstly, we employ random forests to explore how attributes characterizing the climatic conditions, topography, land cover, soil and geology influence (or not) the signatures.</li>
<li>Secondly, we use a conceptual hydrological model (Sacramento) to critically assess which signatures are well captured by the simulations.</li>
<li>Thirdly, we take advantage of the large sample of CAMELS catchments to characterize the spatial smoothness (using Moran’s I) of the signature field.</li>
<li>These three approaches lead to <strong>remarkably similar rankings of the signatures</strong>. We show that <strong>signatures with the noisiest spatial pattern tend to be poorly captured by hydrological simulations</strong>, that their relationship to catchments attributes are elusive (in particular they are not correlated to climatic indices like aridity) and that they are particularly sensitive to discharge uncertainties. We question the utility and reliability of those signatures in experimental and modeling hydrological studies, and we underscore the general importance of accounting for uncertainties in hydrological signatures.</li>

<p>Poblete 2020: Optimization of Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) Using Gridded Meteorological Data and Spatially Varying Parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>Although complex hydrological models with detailed physics are becoming more common, <strong>lumped and semi-distributed models</strong> are still used for many applications and offer some advantages, such as reduced computational cost. Most of these semi-distributed models use the concept of the hydrological response unit or HRU. In the original conception, HRUs are defined as homogeneous structured elements with similar climate, land use, soil and/or pedotransfer properties, and hence a homogeneous hydrological response under equivalent meteorological forcing.</li>
<li>This work presents a <strong>quantitative methodology</strong>, called hereafter the principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis or <strong>PCA/HCPC</strong> method, to construct HRUs using gridded meteorological data and hydrological parameters.</li>
<li>The PCA/HCPC method is tested using the water evaluation and planning system (WEAP) model for the <strong>Alicahue River Basin</strong>, a small and semi-arid catchment of the <strong>Andes, in Central Chile</strong>.</li>
<li>The results show that <strong>with four HRUs, it is possible to reduce the relative within variance of the catchment up to about 10%, an indicator of the homogeneity of the HRUs</strong>. The evaluation of the simulations shows a good agreement with streamflow observations in the outlet of the catchment with an Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) value of <strong>0.79</strong> and also shows the presence of small hydrological extreme areas that generally are neglected due to their relative size.</li>

<p><mark>Di Giuseppe 2016</mark>: The Potential Predictability of Fire Danger Provided by Numerical Weather Prediction</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>global fire danger rating system driven by atmospheric model forcing</strong> has been developed with the aim of providing early warning information to civil protection authorities. The daily predictions of fire danger conditions are based on the U.S. Forest Service National Fire-Danger Rating System (NFDRS), the Canadian Forest Service Fire Weather Index Rating System (FWI), and the Australian McArthur (Mark 5) rating systems.</li>
<li>Weather forcings are provided in real time by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts forecasting system at <strong>25-km resolution</strong>. The global system’s potential predictability is assessed using reanalysis fields as weather forcings.</li>
<li>The Global Fire Emissions Database (<strong>GFED4</strong>) provides <strong>11 yr of observed</strong> <strong>burned areas</strong> from satellite measurements and is used as a validation dataset.</li>
<li>The <strong>fire indices</strong> implemented are <strong>good predictors to highlight dangerous conditions</strong>. High values are correlated with observed fire, and low values correspond to nonobserved events. A more quantitative skill evaluation was performed using the <strong>extremal dependency index</strong>, which is a skill score specifically designed for rare events. It revealed that the three indices were more skillful than the random forecast to detect large fires on a global scale. The performance peaks in the boreal forests, the Mediterranean region, the Amazon rain forests, and Southeast Asia.</li>
<li>The skill scores were then aggregated at the country level to reveal which nations could potentially benefit from the system information to aid decision-making and fire control support. Overall it was found that fire danger modeling based on weather forecasts can provide <strong>reasonable predictability over large parts of the global landmass</strong></li>

<p>Carrasco-Escaff 2024:The key role of extreme weather and climate change in the occurrence of exceptional fire seasons in south-central Chile</p>
<ul>
<li>Unprecedentedly large areas were burned during the 2016/17 and 2022/23 fire seasons in south-central Chile (34-39 ◦ S). These seasonal-aggregated values were <strong>mostly accounted for human-caused wildfires</strong> within a limited period in late January 2017 and early February 2023.</li>
<li>We provide a comprehensive analysis of the meteorological conditions during these events, from <strong>local to hemispheric scales</strong>, and formally <strong>assess the contribution of climate change</strong> to their occurrence. To achieve this, we gathered monthly fire data from the Chilean Forestry Corporation and daily burned area estimates from satellite sources. In-situ and gridded data provided near-surface atmospheric insights, ERA5 reanalysis helped analyze broader wildfire features, high-resolution simulations were used to obtain details of the wind field, and large-ensemble simulations allowed the assessment of climate change’s impact on extreme temperatures during the fires.</li>
<li>This study found extraordinary daily burned area values (&gt;65,000 ha) occurring under extreme surface weather conditions (temperature, humidity, and winds), fostered by strong mid-level subsidence ahead of a ridge and downslope winds converging towards a coastal low. Daytime temperatures and the <strong>water vapor deficit</strong> reached the maximum values observed across the region, well above the previous historical records. We hypothesize that these conditions were crucial in <strong>exacerbating the spread of fire</strong>, along with longer-term atmospheric processes and other non-climatic factors such as fuel availability and increasing human-driven ignitions.</li>
<li>Our findings further reveal that climate change has increased the probability and intensity of extremely warm temperatures in south-central Chile, underscoring anthropogenic forcing as a significant driver of the extreme fire activity in the region.</li>
